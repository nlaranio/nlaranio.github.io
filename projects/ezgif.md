#### Overview of EZGif
EZGif is meant as a plugin to the useful java beginner tool EZJava (now EZGraphics) used by the ICS111 class at UH Manoa; you can find out more about EZJava [here](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~dylank/ics111/). EZJava is a great tool for beginners to learn to code, especially those who learn best visually. One thing that was missing from it was an easy way to implement animation; you generally need to hardcore it which was very time consuming. EZGif is something I put together which allows you to take a number of images sorted by name and create animated objects easily. There are features such as changing the speed of the animation, changing the location, and morphing images in the animation. 

#### Usage
EZGif uses the EZJava framework, so EZJava is required. it can be found [here](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~dylank/ics111/).

 EZJava is an extraordinarilly useful tool for beginners to Java to easily make graphical applications. It supports .png
 image files which is useful, but to make animations with them it can be tedious. EZGif helped remedy that by using the
 Existing API of EZjava and its support of .png images to allowa series of images to be animated easily.The 
 implementation and use requires an images which will be shown in sequence named in order ex. star1, star2, star3... etc.
