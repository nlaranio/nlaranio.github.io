#### Overview of GroupsUp
GroupsUp is an app designed as a group project for ICS314. Our goal as a group was to create social/club app for students at the University of Hawaii Manoa. The application was centered around having group pages and admins for those pages who could update it with events and meeting times. From there users could browse the various groups and find groups relevant to their interests. You can find our more about that project here - [GroupsUp](https://groupsup.github.io).

### My Role
On the team my role was to design the web page theme; colors and logo, code multiple page layouts, set up the routing assets, and connect pages to the database. A prime example of my work is the profile page which I did all of the previously stated tasks. Beyond that, I played a major part in communications and divvying up work.
