#### Overview of Battleship
This battlship game is a Java program based on the board game of the same name. The game as it is supports 2 players taking turns on 1 screen. Players start by placing their ships and then take turns marking spots on a grid to try and hit all of the opponents ships. It was built as a group project in ICS111. It runs on the EZJava framework that was a core component of that class; you can find more about that [here](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~dylank/ics111/).

#### My Role
My role in the group was to develop the grid and all of its assets;
<ul>
 <li>GameBoard object and methods</li>
 <li>Cursor for placing and marking the grid</li>
 <li>Ship object and placement</li>
 <li>Game states such as; hit, miss, win</li>
 <li>Main menu</li>
</ul>
