## The importance of being good at asking questions.
  
  If you've found yourself staring at the same 5 lines of code and wanting to smash your head
  with keyboard, chances are you've had to ask for help on some aspect of programming. Failure
  is key to learning, but sometimes we all need a helping hand; however, it's important to know
  when, where, and how to ask.
  
### Tip 1: Fail.

  No matter your job this is important, but especially so for programmers. If you run try to
  compile something and it won't run properly, or has errors and won't even compile, do
  everyone (yourself included) a favor and try to fix it yourself. If that doesn't work,
  try again, and again, and again, until you think it's impossible. when asking for help it's
  quite easy to tell when you haven't even tried to fix it. For many reasons this is terrible,
  not least of which that you probably won't care to remember how to do fix it when you're shown.
  As well, you really don't want to be the person who people think can't do anything for themself.
  
### Tip 2: Know where to ask.

  This is more for yourself; it will help you get the right information more quickly. If its a
  general programming or software question, places like http://stackoverflow.com/questions might
  be a great place. If you're working with a specific piece of hardware or software, maybe 
  there's a forum for that specific thing (there often is). When you manage to find the right
  place make sure you search around to see if your question or a variation of it has already
  been answered. If you find it and it has an answer, great! You get your answer instantly.
  It also helps keep the places tidy and organized to help people find the information they
  need without sifting through they same repetitive questions.

### Tip 3: Help people help you.

  Be kind, be brief, be concise.
