## Structured Coding
  For an individual making sure you space several times instead of tab or use one return statement
  per function instead of several can be time consuming and frustrating; however, unless you're working
  on a project alone, coding standards are imperative. Sure you may understand what you wrote (albeit in
  some cases it may take a bit) but to be a software engineer is to work with others; when time is
  always important, structure helps engineers communicate effectively. Trading code between people who
  are use the same format makes it far easier and clearer to understand. It's not so different from 
  people who speak the same language with starkly different accents; sure the underlying meaning and
  languge is the same, but one may have trouble understanding, especially on difficult topics.
  
  What truly makes this possible though are IDEs. Without an IDE to help speed up thr process and have
  templates for coding standards integrated such as the combination of ESLint and IntelliJ, the time cost
  of manually formatting may outweigh the gains. Fortunately for all developers that is not the case
  and there really is no excuse not to implement formatting standards as the code can essentially format
  itself.
