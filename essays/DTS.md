##Structured Coding
    For an individual making sure you space several times instead of tab or use one return statement
  per function instead of several can be time consuming and frustrating; however, unless you're working

  some cases it may take a bit) but to be a software engineer is to work with others, and when time is
  always important, structure helps us communicate effectively.
