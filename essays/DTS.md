## Structured Coding
  For an individual making sure you space several times instead of tab or use one return statement
  per function instead of several can be time consuming and frustrating; however, unless you're working
  on a project alone, coding standards are imperative. Sure you may understand what you wrote (albeit in
  some cases it may take a bit) but to be a software engineer is to work with others, and when time is
  always important, structure helps us communicate effectively.
  
  What truly makes this possible though are IDEs. Without an IDE to help speed up thr process and have
  templates for coding standards integrated such as the combination of ESLint and IntelliJ, the time cost
  of manually formatting may outweigh the gains. Fortunately for all developers that is not the case
  and there really is no excuse not to implement formatting standards as the code can essentially format
  itself
