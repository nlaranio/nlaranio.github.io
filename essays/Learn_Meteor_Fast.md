## What just happened?

  Trying to learn Meteor, in roughly two weeks (on top of all my other schoolwork), feels like just going
  through the motions. The result being I'm dubious about my understanding and skills with the framework.
  What makes things worse is that I spent so much more time debugging, Meteor, Npm, and Node, than I did
  writing code. I know more about how to get Meteor running than I do on how to use it. That last bit was
  the crux of all the issues; there were so many parts that we had to get working in unison, every 
  component of which was pretty new to me and most people in the class.
  
  This if just an unfortunate outcome as I definitely want to understand more of the use of Meteor and how
  to implement it in an app or site I can download/visit. I get that we will probably be doing exactly that
  for projects in our ICS class but it will be with such a weak grasp on the framework. It seems like such
  a cool idea that I can build a version of the client-server connection
