JavaScript Experience


As someone who learned C as their first programming language, JavaSCript is a large jump. In fact, on the surface, it makes Java feel closer to the C language than JavaScript. One benefit that initially confused me was the lack of hard structure and syntax, it just runs. I found myself wondering; “where is main?” Learning the syntax takes no time and anything they change from languages like C and Java make sense.  
	Furthermore, even though the tutorial only brushed on objects in JavaScript they seem alien, in a good way.  I’m not sure how to make use of everything in the class but it’s lookup tools just make me excited to find some way to use it.With how easy the language is to
pick up, it's not surprising they threw some things out. For me I felt like the hard syntax and structureforced some organization; and in
the learning process I was just writing functions here and there and the program would run. I think the forced structure of organizing; such as all functions must go somewhere and be declared, really makes any random code you pick up less
alien.
	It’s ease of use and tolerance of mistakes seems to be it’s downfall for me. It may be my diminutive understanding of the code (only using it for about 8 hours), but I found that I immediately became sloppier and it didn’t seem to care. I find that I miss the structure, the declaration of variable types.
	With my minor experience in programming, I personally see this being a good language for prototyping but personally I think from a
software engineering perspective you’d want to use something more robust. Again, I am not a software engineer so I don’t know from professional experience; but, personally  I would prefer trying to utilize c++, especially for database/backend frameworks.
